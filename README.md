Fish dataset created using the following sources (sizes too large for github but contain 1.4k images)

(2015) "Automated detection of rockfish in unconstrained underwater videos using Haar cascades and a new image dataset: labeled fishes in the wild," IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 57-62. https://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/labeled-fishes-in-the-wild/

For the Shark datasets and model used for image generation, I have attached a zip file containing the following:

CNN_fake_dataset_sharks - the final combined dataset containing 4 different shark species and an augmented Oceanic Whitetip dataset

network-snapshot-000520.pkl - a pkl file of the trained model taken at 520 kimgs, this was used to generated the images below
whitetips_520kimg - a collection of 300 randomly generated Oceanic Whitetip images using my StyleGAN2 trained model at 520kimgs

oceanic_whitetips-real - the initial Oceanic Whitetip dataset before reinforcement (there are fair few images with text, but removing them limited the dataset far too much)
oceanic_whitetips-real+fake - the combined real and fake Oceanic Whitetip dataset for comparison with the above
